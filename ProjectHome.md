This is a tool based on Soot framework that is able to record and monitor all the API
made by a given application.

1. Please follow the external link to download the first version of the tool.

2. We rely on this tool to employ a permission certification solution to identify whether a mobile application follows the least privilege principle or request access to needless permissions. All the appropriate files can be found to the "Source" tab.
