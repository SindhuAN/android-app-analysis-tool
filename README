===================Prerequisite============
0. Install JDK and JRE
1. Install the mysql server 
2. Install the Soot framework 
-You can download Soot from the following web page: http://www.sable.mcgill.ca/soot/
3. Create a schema named "mobileapps" 
4. Load the appropriate data 
-mysql -u [uname] -p[pass] mobileapps < mobileapps.sql
5. Download or clone our solution 
6. In "run-instr.sh" script  update the following variables according to your set-up
ANDROID_JARS_DIR=
SOOT_OUTPUT_DIR=
APPS_DIR=
7. In automation.sh script update the line 17 with the same directory of APPS_DIR


============= Analysis ====================


1. Run an android emulator
-A description for how to employ an emulator can be found: http://developer.android.com/tools/devices/managing-avds-cmdline.html
-Run the emulator: emulator @AVD_for_Galaxy_Nexus_by_Google (where @AVD_for_Galaxy_Nexus_by_Google is the name of the device)

2. Run the analysis framework
-./automation.sh

3. Files
Inputs to the analysis framework. Note these files are created during the instrumentation and the execution of the examined application. 

1. static-analysis.app_name.txt == Contains all the raw data of the static analysis
2. dynamic-analysis.app_name.txt == Contains all the raw data of the dynamic analysis
3. output-final-static.app_name.txt == Contains the static analysis data 
4. output-final-dynamic.app_name.txt == Contains the dynamic analysis data 
5. manifest-permissions.app_name.txt == Contains manifest data 

Outputs:

1.  app_name.permissionMap-static.txt == Contains the map of APIs - permissions included in the static analysis 
2.  app_name.static-mapping.txt == Contains the same data as the previous one
3.  app_name.static-final-analysis.txt == Contains the permissions existing both in manifest and in static analysis 
4.  app_name.api-without-permission-in-manifest-static.txt == Contains the APIs without permissions in the manifest static analysis
5.  app_name.unused-permissions-static.txt == Contains the needless permissions - Final static results.
6.  app_name.permissionMap-dynamic.txt == Contains the map of APIs - permissions included in the dymanic analysis
7.  app_name.dynamic-mapping.txt == Contains the same data as the previous one
8.  app_name.dynamic-final-analysis.txt == Contains the permissions existing both in manifest and in dynamic analysis 
9.  app_name.api-without-permission-in-manifest-dynamic.txt == Contains the  permission (and APIs) identified in dynamic analysis and do not exist in manifest 
10. app_name.unused-permissions-dynamic.txt == Contains the needless permissions - Final static results
11. api_name.static-dynamic-similarities.txt == Contains the APIs - permissions that are common to dynamic and in static analysis
12. api_name.android.static-not-in-dynamic.txt == Contains the APIs - permission that exist in static analysis and not in dynamic 
13  manifest-permissions.app_name.txt == Contains the permissions defined in the manifest


uniq-calls-dynamic.name_app.txt == Contains the unique APIs deteremined in dynamic analysis
uniq-calls-static.name_app.txt == Contains the unique APIs deteremined in static analysis



===================Note=================

We do not provide any apk for analysis, you have to donwload from a market or extract them from the phone.
