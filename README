3. Files
Inputs to the analysis framework. Note these files are created during the instrumentation and the execution of the examined application. 
"output-final-static.app_name.txt"== Contains the static analysis data 
"output-final-dynamic.app_name.txt"== Contains the dynamic analysis data 
"manifest-permissions.app_name.txt" == Contains manifest data 

Outputs:
app_name.permissionMap-static.txt == Contains the map of APIs - permissions included in the static analysis 
app_name.static-final-analysis.txt == Contains the permissions existing both in manifest and in static analysis 
app_name.api-without-permission-in-manifest-static.txt == Contains the APIs without permissions in the manifest static analysis
app_name.unused-permissions-static.txt == Contains the needless permissions - Final static results.
app_name.permissionMap-dynamic.txt == Contains the map of APIs - permissions included in the dymanic analysis
app_name.dynamic-final-analysis.txt == Contains the permissions existing both in manifest and in dynamic analysis 
app_name.api-without-permission-in-manifest-dynamic.txt == Contains the APIs without permissions in the manifest static analysis
app_name.unused-permissions-dynamic.txt == Contains the needless permissions - Final static results
